# Array

## 88.Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

### Thought

Apparently we can't use a new array to store the answer. So we need to use num1 to merge the array. We can do this by the end of the array: check the last number of nums1 and nums2 and compare them. Put the result to the end of num1 until i(index of nums1) or j is less than 0. At last we need to consider about if there are surplus numbers in nums2. We can put them all into the nums1.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
 */
var merge = function (nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  let i = m - 1;
  let j = n - 1;
  let k = m + n - 1;

  while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
    if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
      nums1[k--] = nums1[i--];
    } else {
      nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
    }
  }

  while (j >= 0) {
    nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
  }

  return nums1;
};
```

## 27.Remove Element

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```c
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
// It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

### Thought

Technically, we can just make a new array to store answers. But this method doesn't meet the requirements of the question because we need to remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. We can use two-pointer method to solve the problem.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} val
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeElement = function (nums, val) {
  let j = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== val) {
      nums[j++] = nums[i];
    }
  }
  return j;
};
```

## 26.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```c
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

### Thought

The problem is just like 27.
